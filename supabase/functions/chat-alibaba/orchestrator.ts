/**
 * Manager-level orchestration for the internal agent team.
 *
 * Flow per turn:
 *   1. plan()  — a fast model classifies the request semantically (better than
 *      keyword routing), rates its complexity and, when needed, splits it into
 *      bounded subtasks addressed to specific specialists.
 *   2. runTeam() — the specialists run IN PARALLEL as non-streaming workers and
 *      each returns a compact brief.
 *   3. teamContext() — the briefs are folded into the system prompt of the final
 *      streaming answer, which is produced by the lead specialist.
 *
 * Everything is bounded (max 4 subtasks, short outputs, hard timeouts) so a turn
 * never hangs, and every stage emits a status frame so the UI stays transparent.

 - analyst: math, data, finance, strategy, reasoning.
 - writer: prose, copy, documents, translation, summaries.
 - operator: multi-step execution, automation, planning, integrations.
 - general: direct short answers.
Return JSON ONLY:
{"lead":"<specialist>","complexity":"simple|standard|complex","deliverable":"<one line describing the exact artifact the user should receive>","subtasks":[{"agent":"<specialist>","goal":"<self-contained instruction>"}]}
Rules:
- simple = a single short factual or conversational answer. No subtasks.
- standard = one deliverable for one specialist. At most 1 subtask.
- complex = the request names TWO OR MORE distinct deliverables, or needs different specialties (e.g. research + numbers + code + copy). This is the common case for long requests — do not downgrade it. Give 2-4 subtasks.
- Subtasks run in PARALLEL, so each must be independent and self-contained, with no reference to another subtask's output and nothing to ask the user.
- Split by deliverable, never into "step 1 / step 2" of the same deliverable.`;
